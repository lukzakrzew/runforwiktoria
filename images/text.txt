<b>Run for Wiktoria" – Help Her Take Her First Steps!</b>
Wiktoria is a true fighter – even before she was born, she had to fight for her life, weighing just 700 grams during her first surgery. She has overcome every operation, but her journey to independence is far from over.

Spina bifida has left her unable to walk. Damage to her spinal cord and nervous system has caused muscle paralysis, bladder issues, and hydrocephalus. Every day is a battle filled with rehabilitation and expensive medical visits across the country. We are doing everything we can to help her take her first steps – but we cannot do it alone.

That’s why <b>we run for Wiktoria!</b> Every kilometer we run symbolizes her fight for health and mobility. You can help by supporting her rehabilitation and the specialized equipment she desperately needs.

<b>Join us!</b> Your support brings Wiktoria closer to a future where she can not only dream of walking but actually take her first steps.

From the bottom of our hearts – thank you!

Help Wiktoria Walk!

Wiktoria is almost 3 years old and has been fighting since birth against spina bifida. She cannot walk and requires intensive rehabilitation five times a week, specialized orthopedic equipment (a wheelchair and orthoses), and ongoing medical consultations.

The costs are overwhelming for her parents. Your support will give Wiktoria a chance for a better, more independent future.
